- Redo styling and all, fix formatting, etc.
- Add google sign-in so others can't simply DDOS the website like me :P
    - Needed when logging or fetching hours
    - Automatically connects google user to student ID, if need be
- Add a statistics tab so there won't be a reason to perform a brute-force id DDOS in the first place
    - Would present as anonymized data
    - For the current season would have the average, median, range, and standard deviation
    - Have an interactive JQUERY data table of the hours distribution to the nearest hour and to the rounded-up-multiple-of-5 hours
- Add a table of events and their timelines to automatically update the event selection table
    - Users outside of our website can see what we're up to + engagement stats for each event
    - Format not decided for "archived" events
    - Two data tabs for old and current?
        - Three data tabs for old, current, and all?
        - Just add an "archived" label next to the event and display everything?
- Add an automatic event adding tab
    - Would require google sign-in
    - Approved leaders can add automatically
    - Other users would have to request for it to be added
        - Not sure yet where the request goes, a temporary solution would be to email it to you/me, or to the robotics leaders group
        - For approved leaders, a tab to see and accept/deny requests
        - Maybe later - users can send to a specific leader (in case they had one-to-one communication)
- Maybe - firewall or server timeout for users with more than 100 URL requests
    - Have to figure out the specifics
- Admins
    - Once again, recognized by google sign-in
    - Delete old users (maintain engagement times for each event, though)
    - Or keep them as alumni?
        - View times for each student
- "Super admin"
    - Only one person, has the ability to change and update roles
