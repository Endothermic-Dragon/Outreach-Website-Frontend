          <p class="description">FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) is a global organization that aims to inspire young people to be science and technology leaders. FIRST offers a variety of challenging programs for students of different ages, including the FIRST Robotics Competition, FIRST Tech Challenge, and FIRST LEGO League.</p>
          <p class="description">Through these programs, students work in teams to design, build, and program robots to compete in exciting challenges. They also learn important skills such as problem-solving, teamwork, leadership, and communication, while gaining hands-on experience in engineering, coding, and other STEM fields.</p>
          <p class="description">In addition to the technical skills, FIRST also emphasizes core values such as inclusivity, respect, and professionalism. It encourages students to develop a passion for STEM and pursue careers in these fields, while fostering a community of like-minded individuals who share a love for science and technology.</p>
