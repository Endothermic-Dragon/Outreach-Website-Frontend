      <p>Comprised of a diverse group of Hillsborough High School students and mentors, Team 75 works to take part in the annual FIRST® Robotics Competition (FRC). Team 75 is the oldest continuous FRC team in New Jersey. Since its inception in 1996, the team has won numerous awards, including several regional championships and the prestigious FIRST® Impact Award, previously called the Chairman's Award. During the off-season, Team 75 participates in a variety of community service efforts, including demonstrations, STEM events, fundraisers, and more to benefit the local community. Among our ongoing programs are Women In Science and Engineering (WISE) and our annual FIRST® Lego League Regional Qualifying Event, called BoroBlast.</p>
      <p>During the 2022-2023 school year, the RoboRaiders also launched two new FIRST® Technical Challenge (FTC) Teams and introduced five new FIRST® Lego League teams to Hillsborough Middle School's one-team program.</p>
